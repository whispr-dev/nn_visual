fren, could you take the neural net set out in the document attached and convert it into python such that i could run it real time but somehow watch the input, throughput and output visually please?


I've created a real-time visualization of the neural network described in the document! Here's what's happening:

The visualization shows:

Input neurons (left) with oscillating values
Hidden layer neurons (middle) processing the inputs
Output neuron (right) producing the final result
Connection lines whose thickness represents weight values and color represents positive (blue) or negative (red) weights

The neurons are color-coded:

Darker blue indicates higher positive values (closer to +100)
Lighter blue indicates values closer to 0
The number inside each neuron shows its current value

The network implements the exact same math from the document:

Values constrained to -100 to +100 range
Weights and thresholds as specified
Analog activation function

The visualization updates every 50ms to show the network processing in real-time. I've added some oscillation to the input values so you can see how changes propagate through the network.


The visualization shows:

Input neurons (left side) with oscillating values
Hidden layer neurons (middle)
Output neuron (right side)
Connection lines with:

Thickness representing weight magnitude
Blue color for positive weights
Red color for negative weights


Neurons colored by their current value (darker blue = higher value)
Numerical values displayed inside each neuron

The math is exactly the same as in the document, with:

Values constrained to -100 to +100
The same weights and thresholds
The analog activation function

When you run this script, it will open a matplotlib window showing the animated neural network. You can close it by closing the window or pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.


Click any neuron to inject a signal burst of +50 into it
Watch how that signal propagates through the network
The injected signals decay over time (at a rate of 0.95 per step)
You can click multiple neurons to create complex patterns

Try clicking:

Input neurons to see how different input patterns affect the network
Hidden neurons to see how middle-layer activation changes propagate
The output neuron to see how it responds to direct stimulation

The base oscillating pattern is still there, but now you can interact with it!


you'll see:

A yellow flash at the clicked neuron
Expanding ripple circles that fade out
All while keeping the original signal propagation effects

The visual feedback helps you:

See exactly where you clicked
Track when and where you're injecting signals
Get a better sense of how signals flow through the network

Try clicking different neurons rapidly to create interesting patterns of ripples and flashes!


Looking at the Wolfram notebook, I can see it's describing a fascinating neural network architecture! It has several interesting components:

A central "ganglion" that includes:

A fuzzy logic layer
A crosstalk mechanism
An addition layer


Three parallel processing paths:

An RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
A Kohonen SOM (Self-Organizing Map)
An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
